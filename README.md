# Password Generator 

## Description 

- At the start of the challenge a webpage containing the framework for a pre-built password generator was inherited. The task was to construct a program that could take several different user inputs, including the password length and the type of characters that the password should contain. Following this the program would then listen for a click on the create password button and produce a password that adheres to each of the user inputs.
- This type of program could benefit the user as it provides a simplistic way of generating a desired password. Most importantly the user can specify whether or not they would like uppercase characters, numeric characters, lowercase characters, or special characters to be included in the password. This is crucial as websites often have varying rules about which characters they require for passwords, so this program allows users to create multiple custom made passwords for different websites.
- Throughout this project I expanded my knowledge of javascript greatly. Working with for loops taught me how to manipulate arrays to reduce code and read multiple user inputs. By far the most valuable take away from this challenge was learning to use if statements to work through very complex logical problems.

## Usage
- This webpage is designed to produce a password to fit a users specification. The user can input data via typing the length of their desired password into a prompt. Or by clicking ok/cancel to select the character type.
- The length of the password is from 10 characters to 64 and if a user decides to go outside of this range a prompt will appear reminding the user of the password range and the program will restart. 
Below are two screenshots of the webpage.
